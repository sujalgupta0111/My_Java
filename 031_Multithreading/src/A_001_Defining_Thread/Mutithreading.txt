Multitasking 
Executing  several tasks simultaneously is multitaksing 

type of multi tasking 
1. process based MultiTasking 
2.Thread based Multitasking

Process bases multi taksing-->
Executing Several task simultaneously where each task is seperated independent program (process)
It is most Suitable at OS level
Ex--> Ek sath chrome aur Spotify chalana 

Thread based multi threading
Executing Several task simultaneously where eash task is seperated independent part of some program
This is more suitable for Program level

ex-> chrome me under ek thread webpage reder karega ,dusra thread file download karega  
,teesra user se input handel karega 

Advantage of Multitasking(Both)
to increase he performance by reduce response time of system

Main Application areas of Multithreading 
1. to develop Animation
2. to develop Games 
3. to develop web server ,application Server etc to handle requests of user multi threading is used

In process based process is smallest unit
Thread based Thread is smallest unit
thread is part of a process 

Thread
It is smallest Unit of execution within a program 
It is lightweight Subprocess that run independently but share same memory space of the process
allowed  mutipe task to execute cocurrently

Thread vs Process

Thread
1.it is light weight 
2.require less overhead
3.share same space address and cooperative share the same heavy weight processes
4.Interathread communicatiion is not expenxive 
5.Context switching is not expensive  from one thread to another thread 
Processes
1.it is Heavy weight 
2.require more  overhead
3.share same space address and cooperative share the same heavy weight processes
4.Intera thread communication is expenxive 
5.Context switching is not expensive  from one thread to another thread
